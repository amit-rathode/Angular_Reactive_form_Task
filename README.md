# Angular 17_Reactive_form_Task

this is angular Day_8  Reactive form task  

where i have created form using the FormController and FormGroup

in this i learnt the concept of FormController AND FormGroup

FormControl():-
                    It represents a single input field within a form and provides a way to track the value and validation status of that input field

FormGroup() :-
                  FormGroup for organizing and managing multiple FormControl instances, representing a logical group of form controls within a form.
                  It facilitates centralized validation, tracking, and submission of form data.
